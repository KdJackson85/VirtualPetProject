# VirtualPetProject

In Virtual Pet, the programmer is required to create a class object which functions as a digital "pet". 
The users pet should be a type of animal or creature which holds characteristics and traits of a normal pet. 
The user should be able to interact fully with the pet to allow it to perform basic functions and tasks, such as eating, sleeping, or playing. 
These functions when performed should alter/effect certain states of the pet, ie it's behavior, mood, energy level, or hunger level,
ergo creating possible behaviorial outcomes which both the user and pet may experience.
